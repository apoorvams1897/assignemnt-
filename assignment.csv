Joseph Brodsky,01-Jan-65,56736,"The Wise Men will unlearn your name.
Above your head no star will flame.
One weary sound will be the same—
the hoarse roar of the gale.
The shadows fall from your tired eyes
as your lone bedside candle dies,
for here the calendar breeds nights
till stores of candles fail.

What prompts this melancholy key?
A long familiar melody.
It sounds again. So let it be.
Let it sound from this night.
Let it sound in my hour of  death—
as gratefulness of eyes and lips
for that which sometimes makes us lift
our gaze to the far sky.

You glare in silence at the wall.
Your stocking gapes: no gifts at all.
It's clear that you are now too old
to trust in good Saint Nick;
that it's too late for miracles.
—But suddenly, lifting your eyes
to heaven's light, you realize:
your life is a sheer gift.",poetry

Charles Bukowski,a 340 dollar horse and a hundred dollar whore,49569,"don’t ever get the idea I am a poet; you can see me
at the racetrack any day half drunk

who go where the money goes, and sometimes when you
look at these whores these onehundreddollar whores
you wonder sometimes if nature isn’t playing a joke
dealing out so much breast and ass and the way
it’s all hung together, you look and you look and
you look and you can’t believe it; there are ordinary women
and then there is something else that wants to make you
tear up paintings and break albums of Beethoven
across the back of the john; anyhow, the season
was dragging and the big boys were getting busted,
all the non-pros, the producers, the cameraman,
the pushers of Mary, the fur salesman, the owners
themselves, and Saint Louie was running this day:
a sidewheeler that broke when he got in close;
he ran with his head down and was mean and ugly
and 35 to 1, and I put a ten down on him.
the driver broke him wide
took him out by the fence where he’d be alone
even if he had to travel four times as far,
and that’s the way he went it
all the way by the outer fence
traveling two miles in one
and he won like he was mad as hell
and he wasn’t even tired,
and the biggest blonde of all
all ass and breast, hardly anything else
went to the payoff window with me.

Vahni Capildeo,'I Love You',91724,"for Geraldine Monk
'I love you,' he wouldn't say: it was against his philosophy; I-love-you
didn't mean what it meant, plus the verray construction of the phrase
caused bad-old-concrete-lawman-vandal-verbal-mildew-upon-the-grape-
harvest-and-war-for-rare-minerals-required-to-manufacture-commu-
nications-devices damage; saying I-love-you damaged love, subject and
object; plus he could prove this in two dense and delphic languages
suitable for philosophy, opera, cursing, and racking the nerves of arti-
ficial intelligence machines that perhaps could love but would be
hard-wired giammai to dare say so. So what moved him to not-say
I-love-you? What wake-up-and-spoil-the-coffee ashtray-licking djinn? I
have to start to agree. The verbness of it impropriety (eyes glob up the
syringe when you're giving blood: semisolid spiralling); perhaps too
active... I-love-you, I sand you, I drill you, I honey and set you for wasps,
crimson you like a stolen toga, add value applying dye, fight owner-
ship, I cite you to justify skilled outrage, put your name as guarantor
on an astronomical mortgage, I admit desertification comes as a relief,
from I to O, O my oasis, O my mirage. Maybe the verb is a tending-to-
wards? A tightrope? A tropism? A station? But that's meeting him on
his own ground; plus I can't disprove entire languages; plus those
three little words aren't meant as saying. An icy drink in stormlight. A
looked-at leaf left to transpire its own way until... And sans I-love-you
the centuried moon rose above dinnermint stone; many men contin-

And won't be taking prayers til ten.
Ad interim, you put them on.
As if your wants could keep you warm.

As if. You say your shibboleths.
You thumb your beads. You scry the glass.
Night creeps to its precipice

And the broken rim of reason breaks
Again. An obsidian sky betrays you.
Every serrate shadow flays you.

Soon enough, the crow will caw.
The cock will crow. The door will close.

And so wee, wet hours of grief relent.
In thirty years you might forget
Precisely how tonight's pain felt.

Roberto Harrison,"[4,2]",53625,"i fail in the retry of possible gaps
for the middle of canyons
in crumbling lights
for the scarification of vinyl.
it rides through the forest
and throbs a small packet
where parallel seams
scratch a readable surface
on the backs of the camels
in mirages of separate planes
to the bursting eclipse
of pronounceable service,
two spots on its forehead call out
for the country of doubling masses
on a highway that cuts into faces
in line for the city
every stream ties a knot
for an opening under the sea

i lose all my digits
to the moon that will one day be bare
to the parched piles of breathing in farms
to the doorways that promise a morning
on the accident prone to a murder of chance
every mouse in the dust in the kitchen
will harvest the cold
in the sickness of scattering twigs
in the answer of mirrors
for the double that sings with the night
by the prayer full of ashes
under frozen cadavers that once
were the hearts
in the egg of a wound

i disappear in the wrap-up
for invisible letters that leave all the snow
for the hunt to deliver migration
on the mushroom fields full of returns
under beaches in roads by a promise
where the water turns into a home
and the blame of the air will no longer wail
for the spot in the cloud full of planets
while a bubble reenters a womb
for explosions in placards
like the front of a bus
crossing vines in a prairie
that were traced on the skin of a goat

i look at the picture of too many races
for the blood of a horse
that a bundle of sleeping
3 shorted connections
for the change of electrical chairs
under pools of announcements
for the battling showers
that tell all the stories of war
to infants in sight of the corner of trading
for the telephones buried in answers
under barrooms and sawdust and piers
where the songs of an isthmus
circle the beacon
where the moon cannot pull
where a whisper
moves sand off a stone

i weigh every mote in my eye with the fingers of handshakes
they calibrate walks like the wheels of a car
they reflect in a wave
like untying the knot of a bruise full of ice
where once was a number
where the count was eleven
where equality lifts
like the dough
that incarcerates mud clots and showers
for the vanishing thorn
in a guide by the pillow
softly omitted
what the second hand sees
under gears by the hand of a cripple
for the ditch in a face that is fine

i bury my head in the leaves
that the buses were lost in
that day when i looked for her here in the Arctic
when the telephone poles were the marks of equators
when the mornings at home
could not write their own name
when the shepherd was singing too many shields
at the entrance of staring at stars in the basement
with the light in the chest of what follows
with a walking that pulls at two seals
for the trouble in words
in the empty
in the on and off one
why there have to be zeros
to raise all the shores
for piñatas to line themselves up in the snow
under spreading the phase
of recalling the crosshairs
on the hive
that the singing will never return
when the breaking gives others
a prompt to give air

i radio frequencies meant to undress all the parrots
in the knot that a hill on the head
of the viewer can see
without even a monkey to grow
with a molecule’s power
in a black hole instead of a screen
in identity swimming to surface
every outlook reframes on a break
in circular lots
by the parking spot full of directions
where a jacket sinks into the roll
of an orange in Fez
around trains in the mountains
that the pantomime echoes
in the valley of shells that call out
for an engine to answer
when penalties cease in the skull
of another score gone on the pavement
with the sound of a bell that is broken
to bear its first weight in the sand",poetry

All your wrong lovers without certificates
Stamped across their foreheads Impossible

Dear Torch Received your kind invitation
Regret conflagration impossible

You must mean a phantom Your hand at her waist
Your ache at her absence Not mine Impossible

A holy place in the emperor's city
A peach in a stone Impossible

You the mask of a ram I the mask of a bull
Horn chips Mischling Torn doors Impossible

Dance without footprints Dance with no name
in a room with no lovers not touching Impossible

One torchlit and trying to close Impossible

William Walden,A Posy of Love Poems,41969,"4TH CENTURY B.C.

How beautiful, my wellbeloved, is your body of granite—
It smites my eyes like an army with banners.
Your lips are the red wine poured from goatskin bags,
Your brows are warriors' full-drawn bows,
Your glances the arrows they shoot therefrom,
And your hair is the mane of a lion, tawny and thick.

17TH CENTURY

Let us not love tonight past mind
But stifle our intent
Lest blazing passion, unconfined,
Provoke imperilment.

Against the dark, our fierce desire
Would flare too bright for sight,
So must we tame our blinding fire
And bank it for the night.

With luminating dawn's return
And appetite's increase
Our lusty flame can safely burn
In furious release.

18TH CENTURY

Since even modest airs and prudish dress
May not deter rash beaux from wantonness,
Can your unsullied innocence o'ervault
Concupiscent intention to assault?
My sweet, have no misgivings, for you wear
So plainly insurmountable an air
That ogling lechers, hunting am'rous game,
Will blush, apologize, and flee in shame.

19TH CENTURY

Ethereal nightingale, gallantly singing
Your heart out in rich melodies
To insentient stones, earless trees,
And indifferent insects, forsake them! Go winging
To town like a dart to the mark, I implore you,
And, serving as courier bird,
Tell her who is waiting this word:
""I'm locked in my room and can't come but adore you.""",poetry

ask his son to come put a new inner tube on my bike.
Cross Ludlow, past the mailbox on the corner,
Risqué Video, Dino's Pizza, and the Emerald Laundromat.
The fruit trucks tucked into 44th Street on the left,
house eyes shut with boards, fringes of children.
Once we went into a store sunk into the street,
owned by a Cambodian woman. She sold everything,
from evening gowns to soup. Over to Walnut and 45th,
where the Muslim cat sells this chicken wrapped in pita,
draped in cucumber sauce. The pregnant woman
behind the counter writes our order out in Arabic.
We grab a juice from the freezer, some chips,
eye the bean and sweet potato pies.

Back into the hot breath of West Philly, sun is setting.
The sky is smeared squash, tangerines in a glaze.
Three girls and one boy jump doubledutch. A white man
hustles from the video store with a black plastic bag.
We look for money in the street, steal flowers
from the church lawn. The shit stain from the wino
is still on our step. Mr. Jim is washing a car for cash.
John is cleaning his rims to Buju Banton.
Noel is talking sweetly to the big blue-eyed woman.
Linda, on her way to the restaurant. The sister
in the wheelchair buzzes by with her headphones on.

One night, a man was shot and killed on this block,
right outside our thick wood door. But not today.

two stanzas with six eight-word lines each within a larger poem that could

Could’ve been an outfit for the Whitney Biennial

Couldn’t afford one, nor did I need it.

Who cares how you look at the zoo;

it’s about the animals, stupid. Which reminds me,

could’ve been the trail mix I snacked on

&amp; which I managed not to purchase myself.



It was tuna on whole wheat, lettuce, jalapeños;

a one liter bottle of water (Poland Spring.)

Asked for tomato too, which the lady forgot.

You Puerto Rican, she asked? Don’t think so,

said another one in Spanish. Let me answer.

No, what made you think so? The peppers?

“I spent a lifetime building.”

We come down from the mountains. We brought eggs, a table, a windowshade. There were times when we couldn’t bring anything. So many people.

As you were walking up the hill and I was walking down, we almost passed each other. But I grasped your arm and backed up. You said: “This is what I look like now.”

Jeff Daniel Marion,78 RPM,53524,"In the back of the junkhouse
stacked on a cardtable covered
by a ragged bedspread, they rest,
black platters whose music once
crackled, hissed with a static
like shuffling feet, fox trot or two-step,
the slow dance of the needle
riding its merry-go-round,
my mother’s head nestled
on my father’s shoulder as they
turned, lost in the sway of sounds,
summer nights and faraway
places, the syncopation of time
waltzing them to a world
they never dreamed, dance
of then to the dust of now.",poetry

Nice day,
sweet October afternoon
Men walk the sun-shot avenues,
Second, Third, eyes
intent elsewhere
ears communing with transistors in shirt pockets
Bars are full, quiet,
discussion during commercials

Pirates lead New York 4-1, top of the 6th, 2
Yankees on base,    1 man out

What a nice day for all this  !
Handsome women, even
dreamy jailbait, walk
nearly neglected  :
men’s eyes are blank
their thoughts are all in Pittsburgh

Last half of the 9th, the score tied 9-all,
Mazeroski leads off for the Pirates
The 2nd pitch he simply, sweetly
CRACK!

Blocks of afternoon
acres of afternoon
Pennsylvania Turnpikes of afternoon  .  One
diamond stretches out in the sun

Evan Kennedy,(The) Abashed,92173,"Danger from others provoked
a change in my internal
law. I was no flawed creature,
but the unpersuaded
sure made their case
with their brutality.
They tied me to a fence, began
thrashing the life out of me.
If the meek deserve
to jubilee, in what bodies
are we to defend our selves
and supple registers
of bonum. It’s time to confess
I was never cruising for
this bruising but maybe
just cruising
toward a rapid intercession
of effervescent affection
that could gift a beneficent
fever among us.


Angels arrived to inhospitality,
and I hear my body still groan in that aftermath.


❖


I am my desire. Grew up a screw-up
but bucked up a fuck-up,
each thing I took into my nine holes
was rotting, obviously. What perils
when asleep, when en route,
in the sea, in the wilderness
somehow I made it through.
When beside myself, I spotted
an antidote toward
a reversal in all places my biology
doomed me.
True witness was clarified
by my thighs, chest, and throat. To
quote that it’s flesh and it’s not—



Now from my
1394 Utah Street room,
a couple of blocks away,
a strangers’ elegy sinks toward
Earth. To keep watch of community
beyond a shame that stills me—
We’ve been put outside
the populace to offset their enmity.

❖


Singing on my way back to
Assisi a sissy, I’m thrown into a ditch.
It’s my bitch of a knee failing me
after so much cycling that groans
as though flesh has worthy feeling.
These thieves think
I’m a rich troubadour, despite
my nasal whine and valedictory hymn—
the one about poverty, or maybe
I am that bad of a mumbler?
Since I’m not much of
a stumbler, it’s a whim to be made
inert through violence cops not long ago
would round up the likes of me
along Market Street so thanks, men,
for making this human a humble
and stilled thing, alive only
unto your forces. Earth will be
a swallower of your corpses.

❖


Made of dirt, would I know what
dirt tastes like. While I was cycling,
the earth and I
exceeded living bodies’ partitions.
Wishing that the strewn parts of
you long gone ones
would reassemble in a gust
of florescence and soundtracks,
I promise my legs can brace
for any supple clamor.
If the dead all rise age thirty,
at twenty-nine,
still ahead is my finest glamour.
Thus I became a hammer
to darkest anti-matter. Thus
I became a ticking time bomb
of kingdom expectation in
my gray hoodie and sharp teeth.


for Bruce Boone

❖


Bring forth any within you to save you.
So made changeless, a wave or nerve
to enact its fullness. If I’m raised
over waste, hold me there to vomit
the meat I’ve sucked down
and peril I’ve soaked in through
local commotion. There is a continent
San Francisco
at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

What is it to be equipping for
the convenience of
kingdom—      such as swapping spit with
strangers, giving dogs a good scratch
behind the ears,
or fighting from my bicycle
the cars that could spell
my death in the papers. And
drinking milkshakes in Mission diners.
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest,
and I threw up at the sight of that.

My only security has been to garden civility
in city boots scuffled along the way
by impedimenta to my solace.",poetry
Dennis Cooper,ABBA,54885,"for Brad Gooch
We snort all our coke
on the way to the party.
We bring the new album.
We dance while we listen.

The band is two women
whose husbands control them.
They do not speak our language.
Each syllable’s an obstacle.

They are in love with a man.
He is in love with another.
But they’re in no hurry.
They could wait forever.

And when they are out
on the make for a lover,
they’ll always find him.
They are the tigers.

We are stoned too stoned to.
We dance till we’re tired
and listen to lyrics
we mouth like a language.

What we feel, when we
hear them, is inexpressible.
We can’t put into words.
Maybe our dances show it.

ABBA lives for their music.
We long for each other.
They see what we’re doing.
They put it on record.

They play it, we listen.
We are absolutely stunned.
We feel, and they know
more than anyone can say.",poetry
Kathryn Maris,ABC,91305,"Identification is a highly important factor in the mechanism of hysterical symptoms; by this means patients are enabled in their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences, but the experiences of a great number of other persons, and can suffer, as it were, for a whole mass of people, and fill all the parts of a drama by means of their own personalities alone.
— Sigmund Freud
Anne identified with Cate until it became a bona fide
illness, for Boris had left Cate, resulting not only
in psychic estrangement but an unconscious stream

of hostility directed not at Boris, but at his new woman,
Anne, whom Cate viewed as her rival. Cate remained
excessively tender with Boris, though Cate, for him,

had been a “totem animal” from which he gained power
by “eating.” Whereas Boris was the patriarch,
Anne was the ego alien; and whereas Cate was Anne’s

fixation, Anne was no one’s obsession, so she was
admitted to a psychiatric ward with the unbidden
associations she could not be induced to abandon.

On the rare occasions she slept, the manifest and latent
content of her dreams was the dance of abandonment
between Boris and Cate, which Anne, in her waking hours,

projected onto the walls, as though screening a silent film.
She could not be induced to abandon this footage;
she could not be induced to abandon her object love

of Boris (whose own object choice was his
ego-libido); or her identification with Cate, who felt
no friendship towards Anne. Soon Anne drew a mental

triangle on every surface she saw, be it phallic or
concave, and sometimes this triangle was isosceles,
sometimes it was equilateral, and often it was right.",novel

With violinists wandering about
‘Playing soulful Russian music' into the guests' ears.”

Beneath the pressure of the right. With AIDS
You have to think lymphoma—swollen nodes,

A tender spleen, the liver’s jutting edge—
It strikes me suddenly I will oblige

This hunger that announces death is near,
And as I touch him, cold and cavalier,

The language of beneath the diaphragm
Has told me where it’s coming from

And where I’m going, too: soft skin to rocks,
The body reveling until it wrecks

And with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered, ""The names of those who love the Lord.""
""And is mine one?"" said Abou. ""Nay, not so,""
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still; and said, ""I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow men.""

And showed the names whom love of God had blest,
